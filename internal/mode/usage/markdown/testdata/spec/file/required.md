# Environment Variables

## `PRIVATE_KEY`

> path to the private key file

The `PRIVATE_KEY` variable is **required**. It must have a non-empty value.

```bash
export PRIVATE_KEY=/path/to/file  # (non-normative) an absolute file path
export PRIVATE_KEY=./path/to/file # (non-normative) a relative file path
```
