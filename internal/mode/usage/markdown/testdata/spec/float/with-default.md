# Environment Variables

## `WEIGHT`

> weighting for this node

The `WEIGHT` variable **MAY** be left undefined, in which case the default value
of `+123.5` is used. Otherwise, the value **MUST** be a number with an
**OPTIONAL** fractional part.

```

<summary>Floating-point syntax</summary>

Floating-point values can be specified using decimal (base-10) or hexadecimal
(base-16) notation, and may use scientific notation. A leading positive sign
(`+`) is **OPTIONAL**. A leading negative sign (`-`) is **REQUIRED** in order to
specify a negative value.

Internally, the `WEIGHT` variable is represented using a 32-bit floating point
type (`float32`); any value that overflows this data-type is invalid. Values are
rounded to the nearest floating-point number using IEEE 754 unbiased rounding.

The non-finite values `NaN`, `+Inf` and `-Inf` are not accepted.
