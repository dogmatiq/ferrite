# Environment Variables

## `WEIGHT`

> weighting for this node

The `WEIGHT` variable's value **MUST** be between `-10.5` and `+20.5`.

```bash
export WEIGHT=-10.5 # (non-normative) the minimum accepted value
export WEIGHT=+20.5 # (non-normative) the maximum accepted value
export WEIGHT=+3.45 # (non-normative)
export WEIGHT=+8.1  # (non-normative)
```

<summary>Floating-point syntax</summary>

Floating-point values can be specified using decimal (base-10) or hexadecimal
(base-16) notation, and may use scientific notation. A leading positive sign
(`+`) is **OPTIONAL**. A leading negative sign (`-`) is **REQUIRED** in order to
specify a negative value.

Internally, the `WEIGHT` variable is represented using a 32-bit floating point
type (`float32`); any value that overflows this data-type is invalid. Values are
rounded to the nearest floating-point number using IEEE 754 unbiased rounding.

The non-finite values `NaN`, `+Inf` and `-Inf` are not accepted.
