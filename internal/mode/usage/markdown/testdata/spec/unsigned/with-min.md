<summary>Unsigned integer syntax</summary>

Unsigned integers can only be specified using decimal (base-10) notation. A
leading sign (`+` or `-`) is not supported and **MUST NOT** be specified.

Internally, the `WEIGHT` variable is represented using an unsigned 16-bit
integer type (`uint16`); any value that overflows this data-type is invalid.
