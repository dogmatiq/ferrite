<summary>Signed integer syntax</summary>

Signed integers can only be specified using decimal notation. A leading positive
sign (`+`) is **OPTIONAL**. A leading negative sign (`-`) is **REQUIRED** in
order to specify a negative value.

Internally, the `WEIGHT` variable is represented using a signed 8-bit integer
type (`int8`); any value that overflows this data-type is invalid.
