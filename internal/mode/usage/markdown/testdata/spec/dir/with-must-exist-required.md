# Environment Variables

## `CACHE_DIR`

> path to the cache directory

The `CACHE_DIR` variable's value **MUST** refer to a directory that already
exists.

```bash
export CACHE_DIR=/path/to/dir  # (non-normative) an absolute directory path
export CACHE_DIR=./path/to/dir # (non-normative) a relative directory path
```
